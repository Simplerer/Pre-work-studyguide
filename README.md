# Start for Coding Firsts, a study guide

## Description

Given the need to organize what I am learning about the basics of web development, I needed ease of access and a way to practice new skills at the same time. Creating a basic web page that doubles as a study guide helps to accomplish this. The site may be crude but it showcases the steps taken in its development and has helpul notes for using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Navigate to the site and open the Dev tools(CTR+Sht+I) for suggestions where to start. The sections also contain helpful information for those just approaching these topics for the first time.
